# Welecome My Goodman, My Name is Jackson Williamson

I‚Äôm a passionate developer with a love for hands-on work with embedded technologies like Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I also have a great interest in web development, working on both the backend and front end, usually with Node.js-based technologies. 

When I‚Äôm not coding, you might find me engaging in one of my many hobbies‚Äîfrom miniature wargaming and trading card games to designing 3D models for my 3D printing projects. 

Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me!

## Current Projects üõ†Ô∏è

- **[Rainy Arcade](https://github.com/fuzzyers/third-year-studio-2024-rainy-arcade):** Rainy Arcade involved creating a custom arcade machine to showcase games developed at our polytechnic and for future game jams.

**My Role:**
- **Frontend Development:** Designed and implemented the user interface for the arcade machine.
- **Backend Development:** Developed the backend system to manage and load games onto the arcade machine.
- **3D Modeling:** Created 3D models of the arcade machine, which is to be built by the carpentry school.

This project combined my skills in web development and 3D modeling to deliver a functional and visually appealing arcade experience.

- **[Cloudy With a Chance of LoRa](https://github.com/OtagoPolytechnic/Cloudy-with-a-Chance-of-LoRa):** This project focuses on creating a comprehensive weather station equipped with various instruments to develop a robust system. The data is transmitted via LoRa and will be displayed on a frontend interface.

**My Role:**
- **CO‚ÇÇ Sensors:** Designed and built CO‚ÇÇ sensors for real-time monitoring throughout the building.
- **Backend Development:** Developed the backend system to receive data from the LoRa gateway, store it in a PostgreSQL database, and make it available for the frontend.

This project combines hardware development with backend programming to deliver a functional weather monitoring system.
